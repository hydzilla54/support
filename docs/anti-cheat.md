# Anti-cheat

Our anti-cheat is currently in beta, meaning that false-positive kicks are possible. We apologize for this and advise you to report any issues in #bugs in our [Discord server](https://ngmc.co/discord). However, our anti-cheat never issues any bans. Staff members will always manually review evidence. If you believe your ban was unjustified, appeal it at [ngmc.co/request](https://ngmc.co/request). cheating
